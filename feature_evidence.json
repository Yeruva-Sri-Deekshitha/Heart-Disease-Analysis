Verify that the backend actor is correctly initialized and reachable from the frontend, that the `useFilteredPatients` and related React Query hooks in `frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts` are receiving a valid actor instance from `useActor`, and that the query functions are properly awaiting and returning data. Ensure error and loading states are handled so that failures surface visibly rather than silently showing blank chart areas.",
