  "summary": "The diff addresses the frontend data-loading pipeline (REQ-11) by fixing useQueries.ts hooks, adding visible error/loading states in Dashboard.tsx and DataExplorer.tsx, and adding defensive null/empty checks in chart components. However, there is no evidence of any changes to the Motoko backend file (backend/main.mo) required by REQ-12.",

      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "Ensure the Motoko backend actor in backend/main.mo correctly initializes and exposes the synthetic 500-patient dataset on canister startup. Verify that getFilteredPatients, getAllPatients, getDatasetConfig, and getDatasetSize query functions return well-formed, non-empty responses. Dataset must be populated at canister initialization without manual intervention.",
      "reason": "No changes to backend/main.mo appear anywhere in the diff. The diff only modifies frontend files. There is no evidence the backend initialization, init/postupgrade hooks, or query functions were touched.",
